/* Bootloader protocol:
	* RasPi bootloader starts and waits for data on serial connection
	* PC loader sends PING packet to check if RasPi loader is there
	* RasPi loader responds with RDY
	* PC loader sends data using LOAD or ZERO packets
	* RasPi loader responds with ACK or ERR
	* PC loader sends EXEC. RasPi starts executing loaded program.

	Note: if loaded program does not trash memory where bootloader
	resides, it may return to it when done.


  PC -> RasPi packets, always size of bp_hdr:
	* PING - fields other than <p_type> ignored
	* LOAD - <size> bytes to be loaded at <address> follows.
		Loaded data must have <crc32> checksum.
	* ZERO - <size> bytes at <address> must be zeroed.
        * BEEF - <size> bytes at <address> must be filled with 0xDEADBEEF.
	* EXEC - start executing program at <address>
